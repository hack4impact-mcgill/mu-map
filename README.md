## Backend

### 🏗️ Setup
- Ensure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.
- Run `npm install` inside the **backend** folder.
- Run `docker pull kartoza/postgis:latest` to pull a ready-to-go PostgreSQL image with PostGIS.
- Run `docker run --rm --name my_postgis -P -p 5301:5432 kartoza/postgis` to start the container.
- Create a file called **.env** in the backend root and copy the contents of **.sample-env** in it. NOTE: if you are running the (deprecated) Docker
Toolbox instead of Docker Desktop, type `docker-machine ip` into your command line, and paste the output into your `DB_HOST` **.env** variable.
- You can remove the old database image and container to free up space on your machine.

### 🏃 Running
- Make sure docker is running and the Postgres container exists (which was created in the previous section).
- Run `npm start`. You should see some output about the database tables being created. You are ready to work with the API.
- Run `npm run start-migrate` to populate the DB with some sample data.
- Run `npm t` to run unit tests. Unit tests should pass.

## Frontend

- `cd` into **frontend**
- Add a file called **.env** with the appropriate keys from Slack. See **.sample-env** for reference.
- `yarn install` dependencies ([yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) is the same as npm but [fahttps://www.sitepoint.com/yarn-vs-npm/r](url))
- `yarn start` and open the browser to **localhost:3000** or go to **192.168.2.20:3000** on your phone on wifi! 📱
- To debug, open Developer Tools in Chrome or Firefox via right click > inspect or `cmd`/`ctrl`+`shift`+`c`.

## Deployment

🚀 The client-side and server code both deploy automatically when a PR is merged into [`main`](https://github.com/hack4impact-mcgill/mu-map).
- The frontend is deployed and hosted by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
- The backend is deployed via our [CD script](https://github.com/hack4impact-mcgill/mu-map/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy_backend.yml), which generates a [build](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/production-build/), [zip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format))s it, then deploys the artifact to our AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EB). The backend runs on an AWS EC2 instance (which is just a Linux VM). That EC2 is wrapped by an AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to receive and downgrade incoming HTTPS traffic to HTTP. The ELB's IP address is stored as the [A record](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/a-record/) of **[api.mumap.xyz](https://api.mumap.xyz/artist)** in Vercel.
