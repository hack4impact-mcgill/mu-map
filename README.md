### How To Set Up Backend
- Ensure you have npm and docker installed.
- Run `npm install` inside backend folder.
- Run `docker pull kartoza/postgis:latest` to pull a ready-to-go postgres image with postgis.
- Run `docker run --rm --name my_postgis -P -p 5301:5432 kartoza/postgis` to start the container.
- Create a file called **.env** in the backend root and copy the contents of **.sample-env** in it. NOTE: if you are running the (deprecated) docker
toolbox instead of docker desktop, type `docker-machine ip` into your command line, and paste the output into your DB_HOST .env variable.
- You can remove the old database image and container to free up space on your machine.

### How To Run Backend
- Make sure docker is running and the postgres container exists (which was created in the previous section).
- Run "npm start". You should see some output about the database tables being created. You are ready to work with the API.
- Run "npm t" to run unit tests. Unit tests should pass.
